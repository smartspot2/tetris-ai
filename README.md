# tetris-ai
A Tetris AI built with p5.js.

## Overview
This AI generates a list of all possible end states of the current piece, and picks the one with the highest fitness score.
In case of a tie, the AI picks a state at random.

The list of all possible end states is generated by iterating through all possible rotations and all possible starting columns, then simulating a hard drop to determine the final position of the tetromino.
It also checks the fitness score of the piece currently in the hold slot, and will swap if it can give a higher fitness score.

The fitness score is determined by several factors:
* Line clears (reward for line clears)
* Gaps (penalty for creating a gap, but less penalty after the first gap is created in the column)
* Height distribution (penalty for a larger average height difference in adjacent columns)
* Piece height placement/board height (penalty when placed higher, increasing with the square of the height)

The weights of each factor were determined manually through testing.

The AI will always rotate first, then move left and right, then hard drop the piece into place. Currently, there is no support for t-spins or any advanced maneuvers, as they are not accounted for when generating the list of end states. However, the data structure holding the sequence of piece movements was chosen with the intent of giving more flexibility in case of future improvements.

## Gameplay

The rest of the Tetris gameplay is quite standard, and built off of the <a href="https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Tetris_Guideline">Tetris guidelines</a>.

The pieces are <a href="https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Generator">drawn from a bag</a>, meaning all 7 pieces are guaranteed to appear in some order before refilling the bag.

Rotations were implemented based on the <a href="https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS">SRS (Super Rotation System)</a> guidelines, but no wall kicks or other techniques are implemented yet; there is only functionality for the basic rotations.

Keyboard mappings are standard as well, with the left/right arrow keys moving the pieces left/right, the up arrow rotating clockwise, the down arrow as a soft drop, and the `Z` key rotating counterclockwise. Holding a piece is done with the shift key, and a hard drop is the space.

The ghost piece is enabled by default (and cannot be disabled at the moment). It should be noted that it is quite similar visually to the display color of the target end state of the AI, and may be changed in future versions.

However, there are a few aspects of the standard game described by the guidelines that are not currently implemented.

There is currently no scoring system, and the only means of scoring is the number of lines cleared. Drop speed is currently static (can be changed in the settings menu) and not variable based on line clears. There is also no DAS (auto-repeat) support at the moment, as it is tricky to implement the delay and balance the sensitivity.

## Settings

The main UI currently has several settings that can be changed on the fly during the game.

* **Enable AI**: Starts AI, but will still detect keyboard input

* **AI Delay**: Number of frames between AI moves.
 If this is greater than or equal to 0, the AI will wait until the piece comes on screen before making its first move.
  If this is equal to -1, the AI will immediately execute its sequence of moves when the piece is generated.
  
  The current target (chosen) end state will be displayed on teh board in a light color.

* **Frame Rate**: Maximum number of frames per second that p5.js should run at.

* **Drop Frames**: Number of frames to wait before gravity drops the current piece down one row.

* **Show Hints**: Utilizes the AI to suggest the best possible move to make given the current board state.
If there are multiple best moves (i.e. multiple moves with the same fitness score), it will display all of them. Note that this may cause some visual noise when there are a lot of possibilities, as they may overlap.

There are additional configuration options in the configuration file `src/config.js`, but should not be modified, as they may mess up the visual appearance of the p5.js canvas.
